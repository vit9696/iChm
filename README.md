# iChm is a chm file reader for Mac OS X #
###Developer Notes:###
To build this fork of `iChm` (and its submodules), you’ll need at least Xcode 5.1 in OS X 10.9 (Mavericks).

So that you can properly `git diff` Localizable `.strings` files (as defined in `.gitattributes`), add the following to your `~/.gitconfig` file:

	[diff "localizablestrings"]
		textconv = "iconv -f utf-16 -t utf-8"

See [this StackOverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/21020607/277952) for more info.
