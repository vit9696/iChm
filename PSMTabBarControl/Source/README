PSMTabBarControl was originally written by John Pannell

This port of it is solely to update the Interface Builder plugin and keep it working with 10.6+ 
since Interface Builder palettes are now obsolete. This port has removed support for Power-PC
architectures and is intended for Snow Leopard application development though it may work in
Tiger.

If you find issues with the framework code or ibplugin please submit a patch via git or log
an issue in the ticket tracker on this repository.
